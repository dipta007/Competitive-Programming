1. Inscribed circle in triangle:
    A = (p * r) / 2;
       where A = area of triangle
             p = perimeter of triangle
             r = radius of in circle
   OutScribe circle in triangle
    r = (a*b*c) / sqrt((a+b+c) * (a+b-c) * (a-b+c) * (-a+b+c))
    d = a / sin A
    where,
        r = radius
        a,b,c = length of triangle
        d = diameter
        A,B,C = opposite of angle of the sides in triangle

2. Medians divide the triangle into 6 equal areas
3. The medians intersect in a point interior to the triangle, called the centroid, which divides each
of the medians in the ratio 2:1.
4. The medians form a new triangle, called the median triangle. The area of the median triangle is 3/4 of the area of the given triangle in which the medians
were constructed.
5. Two diagonals of a rectangle is equal
6. The length and width of a rectangle are in the ratio of 3:4
7. Be careful when sqrt; sqrt(0) = nan
8. Area of arc = r*r*theta*0.5
    where theta = inside angle of r
9. s = r*theta
    theta is the smallest angle
    so if(theta > 180) theta = 360 - theta;
    where,
        s = length of arc
        r = radius
        theta = inside angle of r
10. cosine rule:
    a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2*b*c*cos A
    where,
        a,b,c = length of sides
        A,B,C = Opposite angle of the sides
11. 60 minutes = 1 degree
    1 degree = PI / 180.0 radian
12. Area of Ellipse = PI * a * b
    Perimeter = 2 * PI * sqrt((a*a + b*b)/2);
    where,
        a = semi major axis
        b = semi minor axis
13. Diagonals of a parallelogram divides it into 2 equal triangle
    Diagonals of a parallelogram divides the diagonal into equal parts
14. Fourth point of parallelogram:
        (i) Get the midpoint of the given diagonal
        (ii) this is the midpoint of another diagonal
        (iii) So get the other coordinate from eqn. solving
15. In Euclidean geometry, a regular polygon is a polygon that is equiangular (all angles are equal in measure) and equilateral (all sides have the same length). Regular polygons may be either convex or star.
