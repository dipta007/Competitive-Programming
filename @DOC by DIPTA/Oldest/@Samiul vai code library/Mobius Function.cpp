/*
Mobius function is a function which has one of the following values:
mu(x) = -1 : square free number with odd prime factors
mu(x) = 1  : square free number with even prime factors
mu(x) = 0  : not a square free number

In order to generate mu() from 1-N, we need to generate all primes between 1-N

/*Application of Mobius function
It is mainly used with inclusion exclusion, when items are the first K primes.
Complexity is improved from 2^k to NloglogN
